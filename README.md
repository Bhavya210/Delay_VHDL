**Overview:**

This repository contains VHDL code files for a delay line (`delay_line.vhdl`) and a buffer (`buf.vhdl`). The README explains the purpose of each module and explores inertial and transport delay concepts.

**Transport Delay:**

Transport delay reflects an instantaneous change in output when the input changes, simplifying modeling but not fully capturing physical signal propagation.

**Buffer Example:**

- Input A changes from '0' to '1' at 10 ns.
- A buffer with a 20 ns delay schedules an event at 30 ns.
- Before the event at 30 ns, A changes to '0' at 20 ns, scheduling another event at 40 ns.
- Transport delay (e.g., 5 ns) causes the output to change 5 ns after the scheduled event. The output lags behind due to inertial and transport delay.

**delay_line.vhdl:**

- **Module:** Implements a delay line with input (`a`) and delayed output (`b`).
- **Usage:** Integrates into designs for precise signal delay.

**Inertial Delay:**

Inertial delay requires sustained input conditions to influence the output, reflecting a realistic view of physical phenomena.

**buf.vhdl:**

- **Module:** Implements a buffer with input (`a`) and buffered output (`b`).
- **Usage:** Provides straightforward signal buffering in digital designs.

**Conclusion:**

The VHDL modules (`delay_line` and `buf`) are versatile components for introducing delays in digital signal processing. Understanding inertial and transport delay is crucial for accurate modeling. Customize and integrate these modules into projects as needed.
